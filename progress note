Jane Q Smith is a 70 y.o. female that presents to ACADEMIC HOSPITAL with Shortness of breath and acute blood less (likely GI) anemia. 
*Probable acute blood loss anemia: Patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during her previous hospitalization. Baseline had previously been 10.0 in July. During that hospital stay, Hb 7.8-9.0 with 2 separate transfusions. B12 and folate were found to be normal. There was concern the patient was bleeding from a GI source. I was following during previous hospitalization. EGD and colonoscopy were negative for source of blood loss. She had a very low reticulocyte count appreciated, so she was started on empiric iron therapy. On discharge, hemoglobin was 8.2. This has down trended to 6.6. 
- Patient transfused 2 units of blood during this admission on 8/24 
- Maintain active type and screen. 
- Consent in chart. 
- EGD without findings of bleeding, Results Are Pending 
- PPI 40mg changed to PO BID 
- Unclear the consultation and hematology will be helpful at this point 
- Continue ASA and plavix given recent fem-pop bypass - may need to discuss length of therapy with vascular 
*Shortness of breath: She continues to have shortness of breath. During previous admission, she had a thorough workup of her shortness of breath. It was thought that this was likely multifactorial including CHF, COPD, anemia, and anxiety. During last admission, she was not noted to have desaturations with ambulation. Once again, the patient is satting well on oxygen and on room air. This is likely compounded by her significant anemia. I do believe that anxiety is also playing a role in her shortness of breath. On exam, her lungs are clear. Chest x-ray is negative for acute airspace disease. Given coronary artery disease history, we will rule her out for ACS although I think this is very unlikely. EKG with no acute changes. 
- Hold home Lasix Hold on further IVF for now 
- Continue Flovent, Atrovent, and albuterol. 
- Frequent H/H 
- Continue supplemental oxygen as needed - although patient is noted to have normal oxygen saturation on room air 
- Cycle cardiac enzymes negative x 2 
- Maintain on telemetry 
- Treat CAD as described below. 
*Hypertension: The patient was noted to be very hypotensive on admission to the emergency room. She received 1 L of normal saline and blood pressures improved to systolics in the 100s to 110s. 
- Hold home Lasix and lisinopril given bleeding 
- Continue atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day with hold parameters SBP less than 100. 
- Continue Imdur 30 mg daily with hold parameters for SBP less than 100. 
*Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient does not seem to be fluid overloaded currently. JVD is difficult to assess given body habitus. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of fluid overload. 
*Coronary artery disease: As above, do not believe that the patient's symptoms are secondary to ACS. However given significant history of coronary artery disease 
- Cardiac enzymes neg x 2 
- Maintain on telemetry. 
- Continue home aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin. 
*Role vascular disease status post femoral/popliteal bypass chronic bilateral heel ulcers: 
- Continue aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin as described above. 
- Continue wound care of bilateral heel ulcers. 
*Urinary incontinence: As noted above, the patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Was thought that this was likely urge incontinence. The patient was hesitant to start medications at this time. 
- Bladder scans every 8 hours. 
- We'll perform I&O catheterization if any signs of retention. 
*Chronic pain: 
- Continue home Tylenol, tramadol, voltaren gel, and lidocaine patches. 
- Continue home Percocet as needed. 
- We'll try to avoid IV narcotics. 
*Hematuria: The patient is noted to have 2+ blood on her UA. During previous hospitalization she was very concerned that she could have a kidney stone. Currently, she has pain all over, so is very difficult to elicit whether she could have a kidney stone. Previous UA did not show blood. As noted above, I do not believe that she is having enough hematuria to cause this degree of anemia. I also do not know how this specimen was obtained. Likely it was obtained with a straight cath, so blood could be from local trauma. 
*FEN/GI: 
- Cardiac diet as tolerated 
*Prophy: 
- No heparin given GI bleed. 
- PPI BID as above. 
___________________________________________________________________ 
Subjective: 
No acute events overnight, however patient states that she felt as though she was unable to gain her oxygen overnight and was given some Ativan with improvement in her symptoms. Upon further discussion with patient this morning she felt that the Ativan helped to open up her lungs are brief, she continues to describe this sensation in her upper abdomen below her lower ribs. She insists that there feels like there is something that can be done about this despite negative workup and imaging up to this point. We further discussed the idea that it might be appropriate to consider SNF placement however patient continues to refuse.
