Jane Q Smith is a 70 y.o. female that presents to ACADEMIC HOSPITAL with Shortness of breath and acute blood less (likely GI) anemia. 
*Acute blood loss anemia: Patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during her previous hospitalization. Baseline had previously been 10.0 in July. During that hospital stay, Hb 7.8-9.0 with 2 separate transfusions. B12 and folate were found to be normal. There was concern the patient was bleeding from a GI source. EGD and colonoscopy were negative for source of blood loss. She had a very low reticulocyte count appreciated, so she was started on empiric iron therapy. On discharge, hemoglobin was 8.2. This has down trended to 6.6. 
- Patient transfused 3 total units of blood during this admission - 2 units of blood on 8/24, 1 additional unit on 8/28. Will give additional unit today. 
- EGD without findings of bleeding of causes 
- Capsule limited but otherwise normal 
- PPI 40mg PO daily at discharge 
- Continue ASA given recent fem-pop bypass - holding plavix appreciate assistance from vascular - at this point given the chronicity of patient's GI bleed and requirements of roughly 6+ units of blood since her discharge after her surgical procedure, will continue to hold Plavix for up to 2 weeks pending stable outpatient hemoglobin. 
*Shortness of breath: She continues to have shortness of breath. During previous admission, she had a thorough workup of her shortness of breath. It was thought that this was likely multifactorial including CHF, COPD, anemia, and anxiety. During last admission, she was not noted to have desaturations with ambulation. Once again, the patient is satting well on oxygen and on room air. This is likely compounded by her significant anemia. I do believe that anxiety is also playing a role in her shortness of breath. On exam, her lungs are clear. Chest x-ray is negative for acute airspace disease. Given coronary artery disease history an EKG was obtained and showed no acute changes. 
- Resumed home Lasix 20mg daily 
- Continue Flovent, Atrovent, and albuterol. 
- Continue supplemental oxygen as needed - although patient is noted to have normal oxygen saturation on room air 
- Started clonazepam 0.5mg BID prn which seems to have help calm patient and improved her breathing 
*Throat Discomfort: - Thrush 
- White plaques noted on the back of patient's throat palate, these are consistent with likely thrush, as patient is on albuterol Atrovent. 
- Continue nystatin swish and swallow 4 times daily 
*Hypertension: The patient was noted to be very hypotensive on admission to the emergency room and generally throughout her admission. She received 1 L of normal saline and blood pressures improved to systolics in the 100s to 110s. 
- Held home Lasix and lisinopril given bleeding and general hypotension on admission 
- Now resumed home lasix but continue to hold lisinopril for now, consider restart at d/c pending blood pressure 
- Continue atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day with hold parameters SBP less than 100. 
- hold Imdur 30 mg for now given optimal BP 
*Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient does not seem to be fluid overloaded currently. JVD is difficult to assess given body habitus. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of fluid overload. 
*Coronary artery disease: As above, do not believe that the patient's symptoms are secondary to ACS. However given significant history of coronary artery disease 
- Cardiac enzymes neg x 2 
- Continue home aspirin, atorvastatin. 
* Vascular disease status post femoral/popliteal bypass chronic bilateral heel ulcers: 
- Continue aspirin holding plavix - appreciate vascular assistance 
- Continue wound care of bilateral heel ulcers. 
- At this point vascular surgery recommends restarting Plavix as soon as possible, however given the number of units that patient has needed since her procedure, this being at least 6 units total in the last several weeks, at this point it seems reasonable to hold Plavix for approximately a 2 week timeframe while monitoring hemoglobin intermittently and then consideration of restarting at that time, with again intermittent monitoring of hemoglobin. 
*Urinary incontinence: As noted above, the patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Was thought that this was likely urge incontinence. The patient was hesitant to start medications at this time. 
- Bladder scans every 8 hours. 
- We'll perform I&O catheterization if any signs of retention. 
*Chronic pain: 
- Continue home Tylenol, tramadol, voltaren gel, and lidocaine patches. 
- Continue home Percocet as needed. 
- We'll try to avoid IV narcotics. 
*Hematuria: The patient is noted to have 2+ blood on her UA. During previous hospitalization she was very concerned that she could have a kidney stone. 
- UA with 2+ blood but no RBCs, CK low, T Bili WNL - don't think this is hemolysis 
- Repeat UA without 2+ blood 
*FEN/GI: 
- Cardiac diet as tolerated 
*Prophy: 
- No heparin given GI bleed. 
- PPI daily as above. 
- Patient now willing to consider SNF 
*Dispo: 
- Plan for SNF placement, based on conversation with patient on 8/30 
- After further discussion with son/daughter and patient, patient thinks that she would like to be able to go to the Brookshire for further therapy. I explained to them unfortunately given the holiday weekend it is unlikely that she'll be able to transfer there until after Monday, but in the meantime we would continue to monitor hemoglobin intermittantly.
