Jane Q Smith is a 70 y.o. female that presents to ACADEMIC HOSPITAL with Shortness of breath and acute blood less (likely GI) anemia. 
*Acute blood loss anemia: Patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during her previous hospitalization. Baseline had previously been 10.0 in July. During that hospital stay, Hb 7.8-9.0 with 2 separate transfusions. B12 and folate were found to be normal. There was concern the patient was bleeding from a GI source. I was following during previous hospitalization. EGD and colonoscopy were negative for source of blood loss. She had a very low reticulocyte count appreciated, so she was started on empiric iron therapy. On discharge, hemoglobin was 8.2. This has down trended to 6.6. 
- Patient transfused 3 total units of blood during this admission - 2 units of blood on 8/24, 1 additional unit on 8/28 
- Maintain active type and screen. 
- Consent in chart. 
- EGD without findings of bleeding of causes 
- Capsule limited but otherwise normal 
- PPI 40mg PO daily at discharge 
- Unclear that consultation and hematology will be helpful at this point 
- Continue ASA given recent fem-pop bypass - holding plavix appreciate assistance from vascular - at this point given the chronicity of patient's GI bleed and requirements of roughly 6+ units of blood since her discharge after her surgical procedure, will continue to hold Plavix for up to 2 weeks pending stable outpatient hemoglobin. 
*Shortness of breath: She continues to have shortness of breath. During previous admission, she had a thorough workup of her shortness of breath. It was thought that this was likely multifactorial including CHF, COPD, anemia, and anxiety. During last admission, she was not noted to have desaturations with ambulation. Once again, the patient is satting well on oxygen and on room air. This is likely compounded by her significant anemia. I do believe that anxiety is also playing a role in her shortness of breath. On exam, her lungs are clear. Chest x-ray is negative for acute airspace disease. Given coronary artery disease history. EKG with no acute changes. 
- Hold home Lasix but will resume at d/c 
- Continue Flovent, Atrovent, and albuterol. 
- Continue supplemental oxygen as needed - although patient is noted to have normal oxygen saturation on room air 
- Cardiac enzymes negative x 2 
- Started clonazepam 0.5mg BID which seems to have help calm patient and improved her breathing and also of note percocet appears to have kept her pain 
*Hypertension: The patient was noted to be very hypotensive on admission to the emergency room. She received 1 L of normal saline and blood pressures improved to systolics in the 100s to 110s. 
- Hold home Lasix and lisinopril given bleeding and general hypotension - this can be resumed at some point in the outpt setting 
- Continue atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day with hold parameters SBP less than 100. 
- Will hold Imdur 30 mg for now given hypotension 
*Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient does not seem to be fluid overloaded currently. JVD is difficult to assess given body habitus. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of fluid overload. 
*Coronary artery disease: As above, do not believe that the patient's symptoms are secondary to ACS. However given significant history of coronary artery disease 
- Cardiac enzymes neg x 2 
- Continue home aspirin, atorvastatin. 
*Role vascular disease status post femoral/popliteal bypass chronic bilateral heel ulcers: 
- Continue aspirin holding plavix - appreciate vascular assistance 
- Continue wound care of bilateral heel ulcers. 
*Urinary incontinence: As noted above, the patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Was thought that this was likely urge incontinence. The patient was hesitant to start medications at this time. 
- Bladder scans every 8 hours. 
- We'll perform I&O catheterization if any signs of retention. 
*Chronic pain: 
- Continue home Tylenol, tramadol, voltaren gel, and lidocaine patches. 
- Continue home Percocet as needed. 
- We'll try to avoid IV narcotics. 
*Hematuria: The patient is noted to have 2+ blood on her UA. During previous hospitalization she was very concerned that she could have a kidney stone. Currently, she has pain all over, so is very difficult to elicit whether she could have a kidney stone. Previous UA did not show blood. 
- UA with 2+ blood but no RBCs, CK low, T Bili WNL - don't think this is hemolysis 
- Repeat UA without 2+ blood 
*FEN/GI: 
- Cardiac diet as tolerated 
*Prophy: 
- No heparin given GI bleed. 
- PPI BID as above. 
- Likely plan for home health discharge as patient is unwilling to go to SNF at this time 
*Dispo: 
8/29 - I spent a good portion of this morning discussing with patient and I feel that she is inappropriate for discharge home. I explained to her that I thought it would be to her benefit as well as to her physical conditioning and medical monitoring for her to consider rehabilitation. I also explained to her that if she were to consider going home she should require 24-hour care for at least one week following discharge. She admits that she does not yet have anyone that can do this for her. I also explained that at this time home health is willing to take her back as a patient, however, if she were to be readmitted so quickly soon after discharge it would be a clear indication that she requires more help than she is willing to admit. At that point, she would no longer be a candidate for home health.

Patient states that generally speaking her breathing has improved since admission, she also noted that this morning she had brown stool in the toilet.
