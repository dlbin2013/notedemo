Anemia 

Jane Q Smith is a 70 y.o. female that presents to ACADEMIC HOSPITAL with Shortness of breath and acute blood less (likely GI) anemia. 
*Acute blood loss anemia: Patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during her previous hospitalization. Baseline had previously been 10.0 in July. During that hospital stay, Hb 7.8-9.0 with 2 separate transfusions. B12 and folate were found to be normal. There was concern the patient was bleeding from a GI source. I was following during previous hospitalization. EGD and colonoscopy were negative for source of blood loss. She had a very low reticulocyte count appreciated, so she was started on empiric iron therapy. On discharge, hemoglobin was 8.2. This has down trended to 6.6. 
- Patient transfused 2 units of blood during this admission on 8/24 
- Maintain active type and screen. 
- Consent in chart. 
- Hgb noted to have downtrended since admission, will recheck Hgb this afternoon 
- EGD without findings of bleeding, Results Are Pending of capsule study - waiting to hear back from GI 
- PPI 40mg changed to PO BID 
- Unclear the consultation and hematology will be helpful at this point 
- Continue ASA and plavix given recent fem-pop bypass - awaiting call back from Vascular for further discussion 
*Shortness of breath: She continues to have shortness of breath. During previous admission, she had a thorough workup of her shortness of breath. It was thought that this was likely multifactorial including CHF, COPD, anemia, and anxiety. During last admission, she was not noted to have desaturations with ambulation. Once again, the patient is satting well on oxygen and on room air. This is likely compounded by her significant anemia. I do believe that anxiety is also playing a role in her shortness of breath. On exam, her lungs are clear. Chest x-ray is negative for acute airspace disease. Given coronary artery disease history, we will rule her out for ACS although I think this is very unlikely. EKG with no acute changes. 
- Hold home Lasix Hold on further IVF for now 
- Continue Flovent, Atrovent, and albuterol. 
- Frequent H/H 
- Continue supplemental oxygen as needed - although patient is noted to have normal oxygen saturation on room air 
- Cycle cardiac enzymes negative x 2 
- Maintain on telemetry 
- Treat CAD as described below. 
- Started clonazepam 0.5mg BID 
*Hypertension: The patient was noted to be very hypotensive on admission to the emergency room. She received 1 L of normal saline and blood pressures improved to systolics in the 100s to 110s. 
- Hold home Lasix and lisinopril given bleeding 
- Continue atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day with hold parameters SBP less than 100. 
- Will hold Imdur 30 mg for now 
*Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient does not seem to be fluid overloaded currently. JVD is difficult to assess given body habitus. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of fluid overload. 
*Coronary artery disease: As above, do not believe that the patient's symptoms are secondary to ACS. However given significant history of coronary artery disease 
- Cardiac enzymes neg x 2 
- Maintain on telemetry. 
- Continue home aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin. 
*Role vascular disease status post femoral/popliteal bypass chronic bilateral heel ulcers: 
- Continue aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin as described above - awaiting call back from surgery for further discussion 
- Continue wound care of bilateral heel ulcers. 
*Urinary incontinence: As noted above, the patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Was thought that this was likely urge incontinence. The patient was hesitant to start medications at this time. 
- Bladder scans every 8 hours. 
- We'll perform I&O catheterization if any signs of retention. 
*Chronic pain: 
- Continue home Tylenol, tramadol, voltaren gel, and lidocaine patches. 
- Continue home Percocet as needed. 
- We'll try to avoid IV narcotics. 
*Hematuria: The patient is noted to have 2+ blood on her UA. During previous hospitalization she was very concerned that she could have a kidney stone. Currently, she has pain all over, so is very difficult to elicit whether she could have a kidney stone. Previous UA did not show blood. 
- UA with 2+ blood but no RBCs, CK low, T Bili WNL - don't hemolysis 
*FEN/GI: 
- Cardiac diet as tolerated 
*Prophy: 
- No heparin given GI bleed. 
- PPI BID as above. 
___________________________________________________________________ 
Subjective: 
Patient admits that since starting clonazepam yesterday evening she generally feels that her breathing is improved. She denies any further difficulty with breathing when urinating. She has not ambulated since admission. We again discussed the need for her to consider SNF placement. Unfortunately she continues to refuse, and does not listen to what I am concerned about. I informed her that based on messages from our home health, it seems that she has a gross misunderstanding of their purpose, and that with the requests that she has made for them she would be better served in a SNF environment.
