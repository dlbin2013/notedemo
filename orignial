Jane Q Smith is a 70 y.o. female that presents to ACADEMIC HOSPITAL with Shortness of breath and acute blood less (likely GI) anemia. 
*Acute blood loss anemia: Patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during her previous hospitalization. Baseline had previously been 10.0 in July. During that hospital stay, Hb 7.8-9.0 with 2 separate transfusions. B12 and folate were found to be normal. There was concern the patient was bleeding from a GI source. I was following during previous hospitalization. EGD and colonoscopy were negative for source of blood loss. She had a very low reticulocyte count appreciated, so she was started on empiric iron therapy. On discharge, hemoglobin was 8.2. This has down trended to 6.6. 
- Patient transfused 3 total units of blood during this admission - 2 units of blood on 8/24, 1 additional unit on 8/28 
- Maintain active type and screen. 
- Consent in chart. 
- EGD without findings of bleeding of causes 
- Capsule limited but otherwise normal 
- PPI 40mg PO daily at discharge 
- Continue ASA given recent fem-pop bypass - holding plavix appreciate assistance from vascular - at this point given the chronicity of patient's GI bleed and requirements of roughly 6+ units of blood since her discharge after her surgical procedure, will continue to hold Plavix for up to 2 weeks pending stable outpatient hemoglobin. 
*Shortness of breath: She continues to have shortness of breath. During previous admission, she had a thorough workup of her shortness of breath. It was thought that this was likely multifactorial including CHF, COPD, anemia, and anxiety. During last admission, she was not noted to have desaturations with ambulation. Once again, the patient is satting well on oxygen and on room air. This is likely compounded by her significant anemia. I do believe that anxiety is also playing a role in her shortness of breath. On exam, her lungs are clear. Chest x-ray is negative for acute airspace disease. Given coronary artery disease history. EKG with no acute changes. 
- Plan to resume home Lasix 
- Continue Flovent, Atrovent, and albuterol. 
- Continue supplemental oxygen as needed - although patient is noted to have normal oxygen saturation on room air 
- Cardiac enzymes negative x 2 
- Started clonazepam 0.5mg BID which seems to have help calm patient and improved her breathing and also of note percocet appears to have kept her pain 
*Hypertension: The patient was noted to be very hypotensive on admission to the emergency room and generally throughout her admission. She received 1 L of normal saline and blood pressures improved to systolics in the 100s to 110s. 
- Held home Lasix and lisinopril given bleeding and general hypotension 
- Will resume home lasix but continue to hold lisinopril for now, consider restart at d/c 
- Continue atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day with hold parameters SBP less than 100. 
- Will hold Imdur 30 mg for now and in the outpt setting as well 
*Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient does not seem to be fluid overloaded currently. JVD is difficult to assess given body habitus. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of fluid overload. 
*Coronary artery disease: As above, do not believe that the patient's symptoms are secondary to ACS. However given significant history of coronary artery disease 
- Cardiac enzymes neg x 2 
- Continue home aspirin, atorvastatin. 
*Role vascular disease status post femoral/popliteal bypass chronic bilateral heel ulcers: 
- Continue aspirin holding plavix - appreciate vascular assistance 
- Continue wound care of bilateral heel ulcers. 
*Urinary incontinence: As noted above, the patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Was thought that this was likely urge incontinence. The patient was hesitant to start medications at this time. 
- Bladder scans every 8 hours. 
- We'll perform I&O catheterization if any signs of retention. 
*Chronic pain: 
- Continue home Tylenol, tramadol, voltaren gel, and lidocaine patches. 
- Continue home Percocet as needed. 
- We'll try to avoid IV narcotics. 
*Hematuria: The patient is noted to have 2+ blood on her UA. During previous hospitalization she was very concerned that she could have a kidney stone. 
- UA with 2+ blood but no RBCs, CK low, T Bili WNL - don't think this is hemolysis 
- Repeat UA without 2+ blood 
*FEN/GI: 
- Cardiac diet as tolerated 
*Prophy: 
- No heparin given GI bleed. 
- PPI daily as above. 
- Patient now willing to consider SNF 
*Dispo: 
- Plan for SNF placement, based on conversation with patient on 8/30 
- Currently patient has not allowed me to discuss these plans with her daughter, however I suspect that she will once again change her mind 
Addendum: 
- Patient has reluctantly to be able to speak with her daughter, after further discussion with daughter and patient, patient thinks that she would like to be able to go to the Brookshire for further therapy. I explained to them unfortunately given the holiday weekend it is unlikely that she'll be able to transfer there until after Monday, but in the meantime we would continue to monitor hemoglobin. 
___________________________________________________________________ 
Subjective: 
As suspected, patient now with complaints once again of shortness of breath and difficulty with ambulating to the bathroom without feeling that shortness of breath, and subsequently states that she cannot be discharged home today, and that she could potentially go home on Tuesday. I confronted patient with the fact that I already knew that her daughter had no idea that she had planned to be discharged today and had no intention of coming to pick her up. I reiterated to the patient that she should not be going home and that her unwillingness to be discharged home today is a further indication of her own subconscious realizing that discharge home is inappropriate. I subsequently spoke more harshly with the patient and told her that her only 2 options at this point are discharge home today or SNF placement likely Tuesday. Patient is subsequently conceded and is willing for nursing placement, if only for one week, and efforts to regain her strength.
